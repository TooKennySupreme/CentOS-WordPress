WordPress-Droplet
=================

Launch a high performance WordPress VPS with minimal effort. Just spin up a CentOS Digital Ocean droplet (we built this script for a 2GB droplet), log into the shell (preferrably with an SSH key), and copy/paste the following:

      bash <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/GigabyteIO/WordPress-Droplet/master/install.sh)
Follow the prompts and voila! You have a lightning fast WordPress server.

This script integrates CentminMod, best security practices, some bug fixes, and a custom WordPress set up tuned for performance via bleeding-edge caching techniques. This set up is no joke.

Feature list and more to come if this script generates any interest.
