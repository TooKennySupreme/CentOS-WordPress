WordPress-Droplet
=================

Launch a high performance WordPress VPS with minimal effort. Just spin up a Digital Ocean droplet (we built this script for a 2GB droplet), log into the shell (preferrably with an SSH key), and copy/paste the following:

      bash <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/GigabyteIO/WordPress-Droplet/master/install.sh)
Follow the prompts and voila! You have a lightning fast WordPress server.
